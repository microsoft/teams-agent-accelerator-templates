# Coffee Agent for Microsoft Teams

Originally from our Build 2025 Lab, this sample is built with the [Teams AI Library v2](https://aka.ms/teamsai-v2), and showcases how easy it is to use activity handlers, adaptive cards, and AI to create a fun, interactive bot with just a few building blocks.

## Key Features

  - â˜• Randomly select a coffee shop and orderer for the day
  - ðŸ“‹ Manage and display submitted coffee orders for the team
  - ðŸ¥¤ Maintains a list of coffee shops and drinks
  - ðŸ•“ Provides a list of opening hours for coffee shops

## Running the Sample

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.x or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Teams Toolkit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) for Visual Studio Code
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A Microsoft Teams account with the ability to upload custom apps
- OpenAI API Key or Azure OpenAI resource.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/teams-agent-accelerator-templates
    cd js/coffee-agent
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the sample environment file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
    - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Microsoft Teams bot ID (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
    - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your bot's password (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
    - Azure OpenAI or OpenAI configurations. See `sample.env` for more details.

### Running the Bot

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
2. Press F5 to start the debug session (Debug Edge)
3. Teams Toolkit will handle:
    - Starting the local bot server
    - Tunneling for external access
    - Opening Teams with your bot loaded
4. Upon installation, the bot will automatically send an adaptive card with your team's coffee order for today!

#### Sample Questions

You can ask the agent questions like:

- "What can you do?"
- "Who should order the coffee today?"
- "I want to add a coffee shop. Can we add the Living Room Cafe. It has two drinks, a Matcha Latte (small) and an Oat Lavender Latte (medium)."
- "Send me an updated list of coffee shops."
