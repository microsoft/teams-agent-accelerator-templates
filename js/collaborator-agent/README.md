# Collaborator Agent for Microsoft Teams

This intelligent collaboration assistant is built with the [Teams AI Library v2](https://aka.ms/teamsai-v2), and showcases how to create a sophisticated bot that can analyze conversations, manage tasks, and search through chat history using advanced AI capabilities and natural language processing.

## Key Features

- üìã **Intelligent Summarization** - Analyze conversations and provide structured summaries with proper participant attribution and topic identification
- ‚úÖ **Action Item Management** - Automatically identify, create, and track action items from team discussions with smart assignment and priority handling
- üîç **Conversation Search** - Search through chat history using natural language queries with time-based filtering and deep linking to original messages

## Running the Sample

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.x or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Teams Toolkit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) for Visual Studio Code
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A Microsoft Teams account with the ability to upload custom apps
- Azure OpenAI resource with GPT-4 deployment

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/teddyam/collaborator-agent
    cd collab-ts
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the sample environment file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
    - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Microsoft Teams bot ID (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
    - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your bot's password (will be automatically generated if using Teams Toolkit)
    - `AOAI_API_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
    - `AOAI_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
    - `AOAI_MODEL`: Your GPT-4 model deployment name
    - See `.env` for more details.

### Running the Bot

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
2. Press F5 to start the debug session (Debug Edge)
3. Teams Toolkit will handle:
    - Starting the local bot server
    - Tunneling for external access
    - Opening Teams with your bot loaded
4. @mention the bot in any conversation to start using its capabilities!

#### Sample Questions

You can ask the Collaborator agent questions like:

**Summarization:**
- "@Collaborator summarize yesterday's discussion"
- "@Collaborator what were the main topics from last week?"
- "@Collaborator give me an overview of recent messages"

**Action Items:**
- "@Collaborator find action items from the past 3 days"
- "@Collaborator create a task to review the proposal by Friday"
- "@Collaborator what tasks are assigned to me?"

**Search:**
- "@Collaborator find messages about the project deadline"
- "@Collaborator search for conversations between Alice and Bob"
- "@Collaborator locate discussions from this morning about the budget"

## Architecture

The Collaborator agent uses a sophisticated multi-capability architecture:

- **Manager**: Coordinates between specialized capabilities and handles natural language time parsing
- **Summarizer**: Analyzes conversation content and provides structured summaries
- **Action Items**: Identifies tasks, manages assignments, and tracks completion
- **Search**: Performs semantic search across conversation history with citation support
- **Context Management**: Global message context handling for concurrent request support

## Deployment

The bot can be deployed to Azure App Service for production use. See deployment documentation for detailed instructions on setting up Azure resources and configuring the production environment.
